# Hi, I'm Lumoma! üëã

## üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently studying Virtual Reality and Game Development at SRH University Heidelberg.  <br>   At the moment, I‚Äôm on an exchange semester at Boise State University, studying GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile).  <br><br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly Open Source Projects.  <br><br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with improving my skills in XR development and exploring networking, audio in games, and mobile development.  <br><br>üå± I‚Äôm currently diving into advanced Unity development for XR projects.  <br><br>üí¨ Ask me about developing VR/AR projects for devices like the Meta Quest or HoloLens 2, as well as creating projects in Unity and Unreal Engine.  <br><br>‚ö° Fun fact: I‚Äôm passionate about tech! Before diving into game development, I trained as an electrician specializing in automation technology.  <br>
